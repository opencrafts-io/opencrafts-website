        <h1>We Love Open Source</h1>
        <h2>The Open Crafts ecosystem is built on open source technologies and we maintain a commitment to open sourcing
            our own work in turn. We do this partially because we believe it’s the right thing to do, but mostly because
            open source is cool.</h2>
